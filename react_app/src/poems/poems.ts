        title: "A Prison Evening",
        author: "Faiz",
        content: `Each star a rung,
        night comes down the spiral
        staircase of the evening.
        The breeze passes by so very close
        as if someone just happened to speak of love.
        In the courtyard,
        the trees are absorbed refugees
        embroidering maps of return on the sky.
        On the roof,
        the moon - lovingly, generously -
        is turning the stars
        into a dust of sheen.
        From every corner, dark-green shadows,
        in ripples, come towards me.
        At any moment they may break over me,
        like the waves of pain each time I remember
        this separation from my lover.
        
        This thought keeps consoling me:
        though tyrants may command that lamps be smashed
        in rooms where lovers are destined to meet,
        they cannot snuff out the moon, so today,
        nor tomorrow, no tyranny will succeed,
        no poison of torture make me bitter,
        if just one evening in prison
        can be so strangely sweet,
        if just one moment anywhere on this earth.`
