        Each star a rung,\n
        night comes down the spiral\n
        staircase of the evening.\n
        The breeze passes by so very close\n
        as if someone just happened to speak of love.\n
        In the courtyard,\n
        the trees are absorbed refugees\n
        embroidering maps of return on the sky.\n
        On the roof,\n
        the moon - lovingly, generously -\n
        is turning the stars\n
        into a dust of sheen.\n
        From every corner, dark-green shadows,\n
        in ripples, come towards me.\n
        At any moment they may break over me,\n
        like the waves of pain each time I remember\n
        this separation from my lover.\n
        \n
        This thought keeps consoling me:\n
        though tyrants may command that lamps be smashed\n
        in rooms where lovers are destined to meet,\n
        they cannot snuff out the moon, so today,\n
        nor tomorrow, no tyranny will succeed,\n
        no poison of torture make me bitter,\n
        if just one evening in prison\n
        can be so strangely sweet,\n
        if just one moment anywhere on this earth.\n`,

    Don't ask me for the same love, my sweetheart\n
    I thought that life was radiant because of you\n
    Why complain of worldly woes, once in your love-affliction\n
    Your countenance brings eternity to the youth of spring\n
    What else is there in the world but for the beauty of your eyes\n
    If you were mine, my destiny would surrender to me\n
    \n
    This was not so, only my wish for it to be\n
    There are sufferings in the world other than the suffering of love\n
    There are pleasures other than the delight of our union\n
    \n
    Dark, heinous spells of uncountable centuries.\n
    Woven into rich silk and precious brocades\n
    being sold in every corner, bodies,\n
    covered in dirt, drenched in blood.\n
    Bodies, burning in hot ovens of disease\n
    Pus seeping from open, lacerating wounds.\n
    \n
    My sight returns to this as well, I am helpless\n
    Your beauty is heart-warming still, but I am helpless\n

    There are sufferings in the world other than the suffering of love\n
    There are pleasures other than the delight of our union\n
    Dont ask me for the same love, my sweetheart!\n`

        The throne got shook, and the tension erupted among the Raajvanshs, the royal heirs of the throne,
In aged India, a new wave of youth was spreading,
All the inhabitants of India had realized the worth of their lost freedom,
All of them had decided to get rid of the British rule,
The old swords started glittering again like new ones in the form of the freedom movement in 1857.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

2
She was as dear to the Nana (Nana Ghunghupant) of Kanpur as her real sister,
Her name was Laxmibai and she was the only daughter of her parents,
She had been with Nana from her early childhood, since she was a school student.
Spear, knife, sword, axe (all different types of weapons used in her time) were her companions all the time.
She had learned by heart the valorous stories of shivaji (a renowned king of Maharashtra) .
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

3
No one could guess whether she was Laxmi or Durga devi (Durga Goddess, also called Bhavani) or reincarnation of Devi durga,
Her expertise in using a sword made the people of Marathward (Pulkit) wonder,
They learned the war strategy of how to attack the prey,
To ambush her prey and to break the vanity were among her favorite supports,
Maharashtra-kul-Devi (The goddess of the Maharashtra) was as dear to her as Bhavani (Durga Devi)
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

With valor in a grand festival, she got married in Jhansi,
After her marriage, Laxmibai came to Jhansi as a queen with shower of joy,
A grand celebration took place in the royal palace of Jhansi. That was a good luck for Bandelos that she came to Jhansi,
That was as Chitra met with Arjun or Shiv had got his beloved Bhavani (Durga) .
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

She came as a good luck to the royal palace of Jhansi and for a log time the palace remained decorated with lighting candles in celebration.
But as days passed the dark clouds of misfortune covered the royal palace.
She stopped wearing bangles for that was the time for a battle.
The queen got widowed and her fate was very unkind to her.
The royal king had no children when he died and the queen was grief stricken.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

6
So the candle of the royal castle blew off and Dalhousie (a British governor) became very happy in his heart about the situation (that the royal palace had no king or someone strong to defend the throne) .
He thought that the time was right to usurp the kingdom.
He sent his soldiers to Citadel and raised the British flag on the royal palace.
The British rule came to Jhansi as the guardian of an orphan.
The Rani saw everything with tears in her eyes that how Jhansi got deserted.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

7
Strong (and Cruel) kings do not care about the cajoling.
They (The British Rulers) came to India in the disguise of poor merchants.
The British governor (Dalhousi) then extended his influence in India and so the fate of India turned over.
He insulted even the feudal and heads of state of India.
The queen took the gesture of a maidservant; the maid was the real queen.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

First of all Indian rulers lost the capital of India, Delhi and subsequently they lost the control of Lucknow.
Peshwa was imprisoned in Bithur and then the Nagpur tragedy occurred.
After the fall of Nagpur, it was not a big task for the intruders to take the control of Udaipur, Tanjore satara and Karnatak.
They already had the control of Sindh, Punjab and Assam.
The tale of fall of Bengal, Madras and many other states was also the same.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

Rani(the queen) wept in her quarter for all that disaster. She was rather lost and was sick of the situation.
Her ornaments and royal clothes were being sold in the markets of Calcutta.
The advertisements for the sale of the royal stuff were being published in the daily newspapers of the British Government.
"Buy the ornaments of Nagpur, Buy the Naulakha locket of Lucknow" had been the highlights of such advertisements.
In this manner the honor of the royal ladies had to be sold to foreigners.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

10
The cottages of poor were full of grief and the royal houses were also full of insult (the royal ladies were maltreated and insulted by the British intruders whereas the poor folk were also in the clutches of the atrocities by the British rulers) .
Brave soldiers of India had in their mind the prestige of their ancestors.
The name of Ghunghupant and Nana, the titles of the great warriors and their weapons, they have lost all such treasure as well.
The beloved sisters of Nana (queen of Jhansi- Rani) invited Nana to visit Ran-Chandi.
The ritual of the holy war of freedom started because they had to awake the divine spirit of the people of India, which had been sleeping so far.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

11
The fire of revolt started from royal palace, which became hot like burning sun when reached to the houses of the poor or common folk.
This spark of freedom started from the inner soul of the people.
It captured Jhansi first then spread in Delhi and also engulfed Lucknow.
The freedom struggle was also in full swing in Merat, Kanpur and Patna.
The people of Jabalpur, Kolhapur were also being inspired from others.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

12
In that great freedom struggle, many brave brothers lost their lives.
Among them were Nana GhunGhupant, Tantya, great Azeemullah,
And many others like Ahmedshah Moulvi, Thakur Kunwar singh, Sainik Abhiram.
Their names will always be shining in the heavens of the ancient history of India,
but they were considered rebels at that time and their great sacrifice was considered a crime against the state of British India.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.

13
Well, leave the tale of the bravery of those great men and let us go to the battlefields of Jhansi,
Where Laxmibai is standing boldly like a man among the other brave men.
Lieutenant Walker reached there and proceeded further in the people's army of the brave men,
Rani drew her sword, the beating of the drums started in the heavens,

[The Queen of Jhansi, Translation by Qazi Muhammad Ahkam]
Walker ran away from the battlefield as Rani defectively wounded him. He was astonished on the agility of Rani.

Rani preceded further and reached Kalpi after taking a hard journey of hundreds of miles.
The horse got exhausted and fell to the ground and the rider (Walker) also fell down immediately.
In the field of Yamuna again Rani was defeating the British.
The victorious Rani proceeded further and took the control of Gawalior.

15
Although the freedom fighters had won, the British army was again getting organized. This time, general smith was in command but he was also being defeated by the brave freedom fighters - he had to be defeated.
Kaana and Mandra (the associates of Rani) were also accompanying her in the war zone. In the battlefield they both were fighting furiously.
But a British commander, Hughrose came from the backside to help his soldiers - Alas! The British soldiers surrounded the Rani from all sides.

Though Rani was deeply wounded, still she was fighting and had managed to get through the British army,
But she got stuck because a sewerage canal was there on the other end and she was in deep trouble,
Her horse got stuck there - the horse was untrained, in the mean time, the British soldiers, riding on their horses reached there.
Rani was all alone while enemies were numerous who were attacking her with their sword from all sides,
Rani, who was fighting like a lioness, succumbed to the wounds and fell down. She had to achieve a glorious death in war (Martyrdom) .

17
Rani was martyred in the battlefield.Her departed soul was then riding a divine vehicle, moving towards heavens
the Light of her divine soul met with the divine light in the heavens, she was the real heir of divinity,
She was only thirty years of age. She was not a human; rather she was divine spirit (a holy being) ,
Who did come, in the gesture of a female freedom fighter, to give us a respectable life of light and freedom,
She showed us the path of freedom, and taught us the lesson of courage, she taught us what we might have learned.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) ,

18
The people of India will remember this debt of yours (O! Rani Laxmaibai) , may you be blessed, dear Rani,
Your this life sacrifice will awake an indestructible soul of freedom in the people,
History may be made silent or if truth is hanged or killed, or if the drinkers become victorious or if they destroy jhansi with cannonballs,
You, by yourself be the memorial of Rani (queen of Jhansi) because you had been an eternal token of courage.
From the mouths of the Bandelas and the Harbolas (Religious singers of Bandelkhand) , 
we heard the tale of the courage of the Queen of Jhansi relating how gallantly she fought like a man against the British intruders: such was the Queen of Jhansi.`,

    author: 'James Robert Pendleton',
    content: `
    When I was five years old, no one listened to me;
Nor heard my silent screams;
No one was there to tell my blistering story; Not even me;
Grandma nor Grandpa, neither Mom had tried;
They were far too busy to notice, the Blazing Red Sky;
Between the Blistering Pains keeping me alive;
And Knowing the Hurt that bound my soul
To the Fears of the Dreadful Unknown;
So, walls did I build so high and proud.
Behind lots of restless noise and many a fake laughter;
No one was to know my Blustery True Story;
A Story, far beyond the control of a scared little boy;

So the solution was simple indeed:
Off to live with a “stranger” and his wife;
With Laddy, Toro and Baron to set the stage;
At first, some happiness did come quietly in;
Calming some of the fears of a scared little boy;
But the Tide did shift the following year;
Grandma Dotty was gone; as was the little blue cottage;
With a thigh high turquoise picket fence.
Unrelenting Fears and Pains crept, silently in;

So once again, not being Heard;
 “Mom” nor “stranger” Dad had even attempted a try;
Dad was off to war and fight in Viet Nam;
They, too, were too busy to notice the brewing, Blazing Red Sky;
From Viet Name to Europe;
Discovering His happiness;
He was never to be home; telling me I didn’t matter;

Between the Blistering Pains letting me know I was alive;
And Knowing the Hurt that bound my soul
To the Fears of the Dreadful Unknown;
I was chained to a trailer of enormous white lies and darkened deceits looming;
Larger than life;
But in truth it was all I had, and it was All Mine;
I had finally learned My Place;
The Pain In My Heart, is not meant to be seen;

With Uneasy, Laughter, and Negative Attention being born;
 Ice Walls I built, to hide the Endured Horrors;
 Pain had permanently engulfed; my little Boy;
The Impossible Ask never to be Spoken;
“Please hold and Love Me”;
Fears of the Dreadful Unknown;
